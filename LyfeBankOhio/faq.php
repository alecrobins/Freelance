        <h2>Is LyfeBank considered a health insurance provider?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">No, LyfeBank is not a health insurance provider. We provide an innovative system for financing the purchase of health insurance and other medically approved services. Funds are contributed pre-tax to employee LyfeVault accounts and the employees choose how to spend the money (with the only restriction being that the funds may only be used to help cover qualified medical expenses). Funds not spent at the end of the year carry forward and the money remaining in an employee’s LyfeVault account at the time he/she stops working for a contributing employer remains accessible to the employee until completely spent.</p>

        <h2>How does LyfeBank work?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">LyfeBank allows you to provide a quality healthcare program to your employees but also alleviates your healthcare insurance management hassles. Here’s how it works.</p>
		<ul class="faq_list">
        	<li>Employer signs an agreement with LyfeBank to establish an account.</li>
            <li>Employer agrees to an amount of money to be paid to all eligible employees (contribution amounts can be based on hours worked or a set amount per month and can vary depending on employee benefit class).</li>
            <li>Every month on the 15th the employer submits a report to LyfeBank that shows the amount of contribution assigned for
each employee.</li>
            <li>On the 20th of the month or the next regular business day, LyfeBank electronically collects contributions from your authorized bank account or a separate zero balance account (ZBA) we help you establish and deposit these funds in a trust account at a federally chartered bank. Using our electronic transactions processing system, we allocate the funds to each employee’s healthcare account as defined in the employer’s report.</li>
        </ul>

     <div id="faq_answer_content">   
        <h2>What are the advantages of using LyfeBank over other programs?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">LyfeBank provides many benefits to you as an employer, including:</p>
		<ul class="faq_list">
        	<li>You control healthcare costs – set what you can afford for contributions (amount not tied to premium costs).</li>
            <li>Easily predict and manage your yearly health benefit costs.</li>
            <li>No group plan premium obligations.</li>
            <li>No hassle management, just send a single payment each month.</li>
            <li>No setting up benefit plans with insurance brokers.</li>
            <li>No policy selection.</li>

     <div id="faq_answer_content">   
        <h2>Is LyfeBank like an HSA?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">The LyfeBank method is similar to an HSA but is much more flexible. For example, funds in an HSA can’t be used to pay insurance premiums and the HSA can only be used in connection with a high-deductible health insurance policy that meets certain guidelines. Unlike the HSA and the high deductible medical policy requirement, the LyfeBank HRA program can be used to pay premiums for any market approved medical, dental, vision, or long-term care policies.</p>

     <div id="faq_answer_content">   
        <h2>As an employer, how much do I contribute to our LyfeBank account?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Contribution amounts can vary by employee classes. Contributions can also be an amount per month or an amount earned per hour of work. Our LyfeBank consultants will assist employer clients in determining contribution amounts by providing a market analysis of individual insurance premium prices in the locations of your employee base. This analysis will help define how much the employer can contribute and with that contribution what level of purchasing power will be available to eligible employees.

     <div id="faq_answer_content">   
        <h2>Are there fees associated with the LyfeBank program?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">LyfeBank charges a one-time fee of $25 per employee to set up a LyfeVault account (Many of our employers pick up this cost for their employees). Then LyfeBank charges a $10 per month service fee for each employee LyfeVault account. This fee covers the following costs; collecting the contributions from the employer, paying monthly insurance premium(s), providing on-line account management to review account balances’ and transactions, the LyfeVault VISA Debit Card for all qualified account holders, and payment of reimbursements where a LyfeVault VISA Debit Card is not accepted or unavailable.

        <h2>Does the LyfeBank program work for my business even if I have employees with health conditions that might not be able to pass individual underwriting?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">LyfeBank and its affiliated insurance brokerage partners have developed some solutions regarding this issue that will help you determine if the LyfeBank program is right for you. Solutions include:
        </p>
		 <ul class="faq_list">
        	<li>It’s at the carrier’s underwriting discretion to accept a customer with health issues, but our insurance broker partners have seen employees with health conditions accepted for coverage. Again, it’s at the discretion of the carrier, but we attempt to clearly communicate that LyfeBank customers bring employer paid benefits and a commitment to health maintenance.</li>
            <li>There are conditions where Health Questionnaires can be waived. Those cases are dependent on state, federal and insurance company regulations. Your Aklins appointed agent who is knowledgeable in protocols can consult with your employee to discuss their specific circumstances to achieve the best result.</li>
            <li>If an employee were not able to pass the underwriting requirements, then they would be eligible in most states for a policy that has some form of state sponsorship (for example, the Washington State High Risk Pool). We understand the premiums for these policies are typically higher than for standard-issue policies. Our insurance partner Aklins Insurance and its team of professional insurance agents can help decide what course of action is best.</li>
