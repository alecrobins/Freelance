<!--How it Works-->

<h1 id="page_title_small">How it works</h1>
<p class="paragraphL">LyfeBank allows you to provide a quality healthcare program to your employees but also alleviates your healthcare insurance management hassles. Here’s how it works:</p>
	<center><img src="images/graphHowItWorkds.jpg" alt="Graph of how LyfeBank works."/></center>
    
   <span id="solution_large_bullets">   
    <ul class="list_large">
    	<li>Employer signs an agreement with LyfeBank to establish an account.</li>
        <li>Employer agrees to an amount of money to be paid to all eligible employees (contribution amounts can be based on hours worked or a set amount per month and can vary depending on employee benefit class).</li>
        <li>Every month on the 15th the employer submits a report to LyfeBank that shows the amount of contribution assigned for each employee.</li>
        <li>On the 20th of the month or the next regular business day, LyfeBank electronically collects contributions from your authorized bank account or a separate zero balance account (ZBA) we help you establish and deposit these funds in a trust account at a federally chartered bank. Using our electronic transactions processing system, we allocate the funds to each employee’s healthcare account as defined in the employer’s report.</li>
